# Introduction

This component provides [Role-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
(RBAC) authorization abstraction for the [mezzio-authorization](https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-authorization)
library.

## Roles, Identities, Permissions

RBAC is based on the idea of **roles**. In a web application, users have an
**identity** (e.g. username, email, etc). Each identified user then has one or
more roles (e.g. admin, editor, guest). Each role has a **permission** to
perform one or more actions (e.g. access an URL, execute specific web API
calls).

In a typical RBAC system:

- A **role** requests access to a permission.
- An **identity** has one or more roles.
- A **permission** is given to a role.

Thus, RBAC has the following model:

- Many-to-many relationship between identities and roles.
- Many-to-many relationship between roles and permissions.
- Roles can have a parent role.

The first requirement for an RBAC system is **identities**. In our scenario, the
users are generated by an authentication system, provided by
[mezzio-authentication](https://github.com/mezzio/mezzio-authentication).
That library provides a PSR-7 request attribute named
`Mezzio\Authentication\UserInterface` when a user is authenticated.
The RBAC system uses this instance to get information about the user's identity.
